<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>This booklet is not intended to be the last word on
Southern Derringers. I suspect that it is merely intended
to be a guide for someone who has more patience than
I to do the research work that is required on a complete
story.</p>
<p>I am listing 29 different makers all of which are
authenticated. This story does not include pocket pistols,
which are of a slightly different shape nor does it include
overcoat pistols or duelling pistols. I think these
are of an entirely different category even if these same
makers produced them.</p>
<p>You may debate the excluding of the following:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>G. Erichson, Houston</dt>
<dt>E. Schmidt, Houston</dt>
<dt>Schmidt &amp; Kosse, Houston</dt>
<dt>H. Trotter, Cameron, Texas</dt>
<dt>Joseph Labadie, Galveston</dt>
<dt>J. H. Happoldt, Charleston, South Carolina</dt>
<dt>M. Dickson, Louisville</dt>
<dt>Hodgkins &amp; Son, Macon, Georgia</dt>
<dt>Wolff and Durringer, Louisville, Kentucky</dt></dl>
<p>Because I live in the Mississippi Valley, the guns that
I am describing are of special interest to me and the
others that can be called southern guns do not fit into
my scheme of things.</p>
<p>Thus I have narrowed down geographically this story
of the derringers of the Mississippi Valley to an exclusive
group. It is sad that so little research work has been
done in this direction in the past. Careful study of other
books shows that only six or eight of these twenty-nine
names and authenticated guns are spoken of in limited
terms.</p>
<p>Since I got my first muzzleloading gun when I was
12 years old, I guess you could say I have been collecting
guns for 38 years. In that length of time I have met
many wonderful people and made numerous everlasting
friends. Among these people are Hume Parks, Hal
Swann, Cecil Godman, Dr. Bill Huckaba, Dr. D. R.
Moore, Leon Jackson, Robin Hale, Harry G. King and
Charles Elias all of which ably assisted me with this
booklet and without those efforts, it would not have
been possible.</p>

<p>During the 20 months in 1969 and 1970 that we have
been displaying our derringers at gun shows we have
won 25 awards. Our derringers have been displayed
from the East Coast to the West Coast and from the
North to the South. Great acclaim was given them at
the National Rifle Association Convention. Considering
the point that awards are won not only on quality or
quantity but on the educational value, we believe that
our display is one of the best. Now that the ice has been
broken towards listing and showing all of the different
southern makers, let us hope that our collector friends
will come up with more information and more details
of when these little known gunsmiths and dealers operated
and perhaps new makers that are not now recognized
or known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>This chart shows the relative rarity of Southern
derringers in the opinion of several knowledgeable collectors.
Position #1 is the easiest to obtain and position #10 is the
hardest to find. The text of this book takes
up each maker in this same order.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">SOUTHERN DERRINGERS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY</span></h2>
<p>Henry Deringer of the famed Philadelphia company
believed that the greatest part of his trade was in the
southern states. It was only proper that many independent
makers of derringer type guns would spring up
throughout the area where they were so popular. The
line from St. Louis to New Orleans was the starting
point for the westward trade and many of these guns
were carried as a hideout weapon to California during
the most popular period from 1845 through 1870. A
casual study shows great differences between the southern
made derringers and those of Philadelphia, each of
which has its own peculiar and particular characteristics.</p>
<p>In the court case of Henry Deringer vs. Plate, Deringer
states that he started producing his celebrated small
gun in 1825. A careful study of the southern manufactured
derringers shows that all of them started around
1855 or later with some of them continuing production
until the 1870s.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of Southern Derringers; those
that are made by Henry Deringer with agent markings
and those that are manufactured in the South.</p>
<p>Henry Deringer pistols bearing agents names and
marked with the legend &ldquo;MAN^d for&rdquo; appear to date
from the earlier period of his manufacture.</p>
<p>Later pistols omit this stamping and read, for example:</p>
<p class="center">WOLF &amp; DURRINGER LOUISE KY AGENTS
<br />LULLMAN &amp; VIENNA MEMPHIS, TENN.</p>
<p>Please note that the Calhoun, Hyde &amp; Goodrich, J. B.
Gilmore, Lullman &amp; Vienna and the two F. H. Clarks
are marked with the earlier marking, while the Swett,
the one F. H. Clark and the two Lullman &amp; Vienna&rsquo;s are
marked with the later type of stamping. These are the
only guns in my collection that are genuine Henry
Deringers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Of those southern made derringers that are manufactured
in that area, only a few have the escutcheon
plate underneath the forearm with a screw through the
plate holding the barrel. Most of this type did not use
a wedge but one did use a wedge and this screw. Many
used a screw through the trigger plate to the barrel.</p>
<p>A few of the southern made derringers had flat butts
particularly those of Nashville and Memphis.</p>
<p>About half of the southern manufactured guns had
octagon barrels and the other half had those of the
Henry Derringer style with a round barrel and a rib on
top.</p>
<p>Never before have I observed a gun photograph using
a mirror to show the underside of a forearm and the
guard. Although this innovation is about 1&frac12; inches out
of focus, because of the extra light travel, it does show
these features that are otherwise hidden and that are
very important in identification. All of this photography,
and for our catalog, is done with an ancient Polaroid
with portrait lenses.</p>
<p>In 1957 I obtained my first specimen of a southern
made derringer from Nathan Swayze, author of &ldquo;51
Colt Navies&rdquo;, at the Jackson Mississippi Gun Show.
This was a Glassick Derringer as was my second gun
obtained later that year at another Jackson Mississippi
Gun Show.</p>
<p>About one year later from Horace Tolliver of Manchester,
Tennessee I traded for two more derringers,
one a Glassick and the other a Schneider &amp; Glassick.</p>
<p>By 1961 I had six or eight different guns and I cannot
now remember in what order they arrived and who I
obtained them from. About 1962 I stopped buying Yankee.
Deringers and still have thirty odd such pieces. They
were too easy to get.</p>
<p>By this time I began to hear rumors of other makers
that were not listed in any of the gun books and I drifted
along for a few years until about 1965 or 1966 gathering
together perhaps a total of fifteen or eighteen of the
guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>My appetite was whetted in 1963 when Theodore
Dexter, a prominent gun dealer of that time, offered
for sale a pair of Louis Hoffman, Vicksburg, Mississippi
derringers in awfully nice condition. So, another pair
had turned up that I had never heard of nor had anyone
ever seen before. One of these guns is now in Mississippi
near Vicksburg and the other is in a prominent collection
in California and someday I would like to get
these two back together and perhaps in my possession.
All of this information made me real warm towards expanding
the collection of Southern Derringers especially
after I saw an O&rsquo;Dell, a Linde and a Merriman.
Slowing somewhat in my collection of military long guns
before 1890, my collection of Kentucky Rifles, Colt
Pistols, Confederate Revolvers, Confederate Veterans
Reunion Badges and certain other items, I began to
concentrate more on the Southern Derringers until today
I have over fifty of these guns.</p>
<p>Five guns exist that I do not have. They are A. J.
Millspaugh, Shreveport, H. G. Newcomb, Natchez, J.
A. Schaffer, Vicksburg, Louis Hoffman, Vicksburg and
Holyoake-Lownes &amp; Co. One other, F. Schumann is
authenticated by newspaper accounts of that period as
having made derringers but not a single specimen has
ever turned up according to my collector friends. Of
great importance though is a derringer barrel, octagon
in shape, marked &ldquo;F. Schumann, Memphis, Tennessee&rdquo;
that has never been assembled or made into a gun. This
specimen is in Dixie&rsquo;s collection and was found 30 years
ago in an old Memphis gun repair store.</p>
<p>By no means have I completed my collection. I do
look forward to years of hunting for additional pieces,
adding more information to my papers and if enough
of you good readers are interested in this book so that
I can dispose of the first 1000 copies, I will look forward
to the time when it can be reprinted with additional information.</p>

<h3>HYDE &amp; GOODRICH</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="529" />
</div>
<p>#2 The vast majority of Hyde and Goodrich deringers
are usually of a bulky undesirable style that I do
not like. This one follows that example. Caliber is .410.
Has German silver furniture and with ramrod. The
barrel markings on #2, #255, and #284 use the same
single stamp.</p>
<p>The barrel is marked in three lines as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for
<br />Hyde and Goodrich
<br />Agents, N. O.</p>
<p>In a City Directory of 1853 this company was listed
as dealers in &ldquo;guns, pistols and military goods.&rdquo; They
imported a number of arms just prior to the war, marked
&ldquo;Hyde &amp; Goodrich, Agents for the United States
South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1861 the firm was changed into Thomas, Griswold
&amp; Company, both Thomas and Griswold having been
former employees of Hyde &amp; Goodrich.</p>
<p>One of the principles of Hyde &amp; Goodrich; A. L.
Hyde, withdrew from the firm on August 23, 1861.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3>HYDE &amp; GOODRICH</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" />
</div>
<p>#255 Another Hyde and Goodrich except this one
has gold bands at the breech and sterling silver furniture
which makes it somewhat more desirable. This is
one of the fattest and bulkiest Henry Deringer that I
have ever seen. Made without ramrod. Cap box in butt.
.380 caliber.</p>
<p>Marked in three lines with one die stamp on the barrel
as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for
<br />Hyde and Goodrich
<br />Agents, N. O.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3>HYDE &amp; GOODRICH</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="532" />
</div>
<p>#284 This is an extremely fine Hyde and Goodrich
with 100% original browning on the barrel and
95% of the original varnish. It has the excellent quality
classic style in the stock contour. Double gold banded
breech. Furniture is German silver. Made with ramrod
and capbox in butt. Muzzle of the barrel is fluted. Caliber
is .420.</p>
<p>Remember that all Hyde and Goodrich deringers are
genuine Henry Deringer guns and are not manufactured
by Hyde and Goodrich. These four guns and all that I
have ever seen have the pineapple finial on the trigger
guard. Be sure that you note the different kinds of Henry
Deringer barrel markings when the agent&rsquo;s names is
used. For instance, in the case of Hyde and Goodrich
Henry Deringer guns that are in my collection, there
are two different types of barrel stampings.</p>
<p>Marked with one stamp on the barrel only:</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for
<br />Hyde and Goodrich
<br />Agents, N. O.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" />
</div>
<p>#3 Still the same is this Hyde and Goodrich gun
that is bulky and I do not think pretty. Made with ramrod
and German silver mountings. Caliber is .390.</p>
<p>Contrary to the other guns, this one is marked with
four different hand stamps as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for
<br />Hyde and Goodrich
<br />Agents, N. Orleans</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3>HYDE &amp; GOODRICH</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="461" />
</div>
<p>This is a fake Hyde &amp; Goodrich, it being a Belgian
produced derringer in what is apparently an original
case with accessories. The barrel is Belgian proofed
underneath.</p>
<p>The point in showing this fake gun in this book is
that somewhere on the West Coast someone is running
around stamping odd derringers with the name Hyde &amp;
Goodrich as follows in three lines.</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for
<br />Hyde and Goodrich
<br />Agents, N. O.</p>
<p>When the fellow at the Las Vegas Show walked up
to my table and showed me the gun my eyes popped out
that here was a cased Hyde &amp; Goodrich and I did not
stop to analyze it. From the contour of the gun and the
French type casing, I should have realized that it was
not an American gun. It was reasonably priced and I
shelled out the money within about thirty seconds after
looking at the gun.</p>
<p>Then that night up in the hotel room I got to looking
at the gun and remembered that I had seen the same
gun at the Disneyland Show six months before and it
was not marked at that time. Then I examined the barrel
stampings closer and realized that they were new stampings.
Upon my arrival home I compared this stamping
with other guns in our collection and found that this
was a good facsimile but the spacing of the letters was
not the same as on the original. And then, there were
other minute differences in the letters that showed it
was new.</p>
<p>As in most of these cases, the fellow I bought it from
refused to refund my money and I got stuck with it.</p>
<p>But it is a good lesson to not buy anything too quick
or that is rare or at a high price unless you study it
out first to be sure it is not faked or altered.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="459" />
</div>
<p>#251 This derringer is one of a matched pair manufactured
by Henry Deringer of Philadelphia. The furniture
is German silver and the stock is made without
ramrod. Two silver bands at the breech of the barrel
add to their value. This pair is in exceptionally fine
condition retaining nearly all of the varnish and the
original smooth brown finish of the barrels. A desirable
small style of an ideal shape. Has pineapple trigger
guard finial. Silver tear shaped inlay at butt. Caliber is
.38.</p>
<p>Marked on the top barrel flat in four lines with one
hand stamp as follows:</p>

<p>#276 A very fine F. H. Clark genuine Henry Derringer
pistol with two silver bands at the breech. Typical
trigger guard has pineapple finial. Made without ramrod.
This is a desirable small size gun. .43 caliber.</p>
<p>Marked on the barrel in four lines as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for

</div>
<p>#273 Same description as #276 with the exception
that this stock is a little smaller and the grip is slightly
different in shape. In general, a more slender gun. A
high quality gun with double silver banded breech and
the same marking on the barrel. Made without ramrod
and with a tear drop for a butt cap. German silver
mounted. Caliber is .410.</p>
<p>Apparently one hand stamp was used to mark the
four lines on the barrel as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for

<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="530" />
</div>
<p>#229 Now, this gun is a little bit different from a
genuine Henry Deringer in that this one was produced
by the F. H. Clark Company in Memphis. Notice the
extra stubby bird head grip. German silver mounted
throughout even to the ramrod thimble. Notice that
there is no screw holding the barrel to the forearm and
is held in place with the wedge only. Very coarse
checkering. The caliber is .420.</p>
<p>Marked on the breechblock on the top barrel flat:</p>

</div>
<p>#236 Another original F. H. Clark gun but this one
has bag grips, steel trigger guard, and steel thimble with
a silver nosecap. Notice that this one has a screw in the
trigger guard finial holding the barrel to the forearm
plus the wedge through the forearm. Made with ramrod
and has a tear drop butt cap. The stock has been
broken at the rear of the barrel and an ancient steel inlay
has been placed in the wood each side of the stock
above the triggerguard. Caliber is .430.</p>

</div>
<p>#280 A fine matched pair of Clark manufactured
derringers that I obtained in 1970 from a gun auction
in England. How they got to England, I don&rsquo;t know.
With them was the original case with all the compartments
broken and loose. The case has been sent to an
expert to have it restored.</p>
<p>Notice that it is a bag grip type of gun. No screw in
the trigger guard finial holding to the barrel. The trigger
guard and thimble are steel and the balance of the inlays
are German silver. These are apparently the original
ramrods. A matched pair of guns are very, very
rare; and these two are in very nice condition. Caliber
is .440.</p>
<p>Marked on the breechblock at the top barrel flat position
as follows:</p>
<p class="center">F. H. Clark &amp; Co.

</div>
<p>#217 This is as fine a pair of matched derringers
by Clark as money can buy anywhere. Beautifully browned
barrels with 100% of the fine French varnish on the
wood remaining. Has steel trigger guard and thimble,
but does not have a screw in the trigger guard finial
holding to the barrel. A rather large sized derringer.
Bag grips have silver tear drop butt escutcheon.</p>
<p>There is an interesting story about this matched pair
of guns and how they were found. About four years ago
a friend from England wrote that he had these guns in
his possession and he had gotten them from a collection
in Norway. How they got to Norway, only Heaven
knows. Anyway, they were so high priced that I passed
them up. A friend of mine, Cecil Godwin, did get the
guns and two years later I wanted them so badly that
I paid him a handsome profit so that I could add them
to my collection. They are even so fine that they have
the original ramrods intact. Caliber is .420.</p>
<p>The breechplug of the barrel on the top flat is marked
in two lines with the metal still puffed up around the
letters because it is so new and without any wear. They
are marked in two lines as follows:</p>

<p>#268 A Memphis manufactured gun by F. H. Clark
with steel trigger guard and thimble. All other inlays
are of German silver. Made without screw in forearm
or trigger guard that goes direct to barrel. Any derringer
such as this one with a barrel 4&frac34;&rdquo; long is considered
to be a large size. Notice that this gun has bag grips
and not bird head style. Caliber is .430.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM S. SCHNEIDER</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="527" />
</div>
<p>#248 A Schneider and Company derringer that is
a medium size for this brand of gun. Barrel is full octagon.
Trigger guard and tear drop buttcap are made
of sterling silver and other inlays are of German silver.
Made without ramrod. The stock forearm at the nose is
fluted. Trigger guard finial has a screw going through
to the barrel to hold the gun together, along with the
wedge helping to hold the forearm to the barrel. Most
of the Schneider guns have a definite pronounced curve
shape to the lock. Notice how low the hammer is. The
lockplate is very plain with a simple lined border. The
caliber of this specimen is .450.</p>
<p>The serial number of this gun is #122, the highest
known. Of all the Southern made derringers, this is the
only maker that serial numbered his guns. Of course
this is an assumption that the number on top of the
breechblock is the serial number, but all that we have
ever seen had a similar number in this position. Assuming
that the Schneider Company manufactured one
hundred and twenty-two pieces, and that possibly thirty
of these guns are in existence, this means that the survival
rate is one out of four. Bearing in mind that this
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
survival rate is only an assumption, consider how few
guns some of the lesser known makers must have produced.
At this rate, for instance, Siebert should not have
produced many over six or eight guns.</p>
<p>I have known of this gun&rsquo;s existence for nearly thirty
years. In 1943 when I was taking the train from Union
City to Chattanooga, I happened to sit down by a Mr.
Fain Taylor from Greenfield, twenty miles away. We
got to talking and found out that we were both interested
in guns, and he told me that he had this gun. Then
after the War was over, I went by to visit him and see
his collection. Of course, this gun was not for sale. At
that time and during the years gone by in the 1930&rsquo;s he
used this little pistol as a training gun for his bird
dogs out in the field.</p>
<p>The years went by and I would see him ever so often
and ask him about his gun. Finally, in 1967 he appeared
at the store one day and said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to let
you have my gun. You like these Southern derringers
so well that I think the best place for this gun to be is
in your collection.&rdquo; With that, I paid him the going rate
for this type of gun and of course I don&rsquo;t think that I
will ever dispose of it in my lifetime.</p>
<p>The barrel is marked on the top flat in two lines with
one stamp as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Schneider &amp; Co.
<br />Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p>Schneider was a gunsmith in the 1850&rsquo;s and later a
member of the revolver making firm of Schneider and
Glassick.</p>

<p>#283 All Schneider derringers that I have ever seen
were marked with the same two line one piece stamp.
Clearly seen in the photograph is the screw in the trigger
plate holding the stock to the rear of the barrel. Butt
is nicely checkered and is flat with an oval buttcap. In
addition to the screw, the barrel is held in place with
a wedge. The deeply curved lock is very plain with a
simple engraved line border. Full octagon barrel. The
serial number 55 is stamped on the top of the breechplug
flat. On the tang is a #1 which leaves some thought
that this might be #1 of a pair. The nose of the forearm
is fluted. Of some importance to me is the fact that this
is a sheath trigger pistol, and the trigger plate and
sheath are of German silver. Bitterlick of Nashville
made this type of gun with a sheath trigger and a flat
butt. The caliber is .380.</p>
<p>The top barrel flat is marked in two lines with one

<p>#275. This Schneider has excellent styling and is
typical of many Memphis &amp; Nashville guns. The screw
through the trigger plate extends into the barrel to hold
the gun together. Made with the wedge through the
forearm. The nose of the forearm is fluted. Flat butt
with oval German silver inlay. Deeply curved lock
is very plain with simple lined border. The serial
number on the top flat of the breechplug is #8 with a
#1 on the tang which leaves the thought that this
might be one of a pair. Full octagon steel barrel with
steel dovetailed front sight. This is the sheath trigger
style with a steel trigger plate and sheath, just the
opposite material from #283.</p>

<p>#267 This Schneider derringer is the third or fourth
Southern made gun that I obtained fifteen years ago.
My good friend Horace Tolliver of Manchester, Tennessee,
had the gun. Remember that this Schneider is made
with a regular trigger guard instead of the sheath trigger
guard. The inlays and guard have no engraving
with line engraving only on the trigger plate. Semi-formed
bird head grip with a tear drop German silver
butt plate. Notice how low the hammer is on the gun.
Someone in years gone by attempted to dress up the
gun by checkering the forearm; but of course this hurt
it some. The nose of the forearm is fluted. There is no
screw through the trigger plate holding the barrel in
place. This barrel is not octagon, but instead is a round
barrel with a rib on top similar to all those made by
Henry Deringer. Steel dovetailed front sight. Caliber is
.440.</p>
<p>Marked on the top barrel flat with one two line hand
stamp as follows:</p>

<p>#214 This Glassick derringer is German silver mounted
throughout and has a standard derringer style
trigger guard. Through the trigger plate at the finial is
a metal screw that attaches the plate to the barrel which
is doubly held in place by another screw through an
escutcheon under the forearm into the barrel. Made
without wedge. The lock has the pronounced downward
curve. Full octagon barrel. Butt is flat with an oval
German silver inlay without capbox. Checkering is rather
coarse. The German silver blade front sight is milled
into the barrel. Caliber is .400.</p>
<p>Marked with one hand stamp in one line on the top
barrel flat. The barrel is so short and the one line is so
long that part of the name is on the breech-plug on this
particular gun. The same hand stamp was used to mark
#209 as was used on this one and is worded as follows:</p>
<p class="center">F. Glassick &amp; Co., Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p>Glassick was a gunsmith circa 1850, whose name is
found stamped on imitation derringer pistols. About
1859 he entered into a partnership to form Schneider
and Glassick.</p>

</div>
<p>#209 Glassick derringers are in high demand like
the Griswold and Greer Confederate revolver, though
they are relatively easy to get, but command a good
price. I suppose it is because Glassick and Schneider are
so well known that they will bring more money than
some of the lesser known derringers.</p>
<p>This version is a real work of art in some respects.
All inlays are of sterling silver. This model is made with
a ramrod and with an oval sterling silver butt cap with
cap box built in. Although this gun shows 75% original
varnish, in the past the grip has been broken into two
pieces and is carefully repaired with an inlay all the way
around. To make this grip inlay required a great deal of
efficiency on the part of the person that did it because
it is just absolutely perfect the way that it is put in
with steel screws. Then the forearm apparently is
cracked underneath the wide inlay that is highly engraved.
These two silver inlay repair jobs, in my opinion,
add quite a bit of value to the gun because of their
beauty and quality of workmanship. This gun has a full
octagon barrel and its breech is gold banded. The front
sight has a steel dovetailed base with a sterling silver
blade. The lock may not be curved as much as other
Memphis guns, but it does have the low profile hammer.
Glassick derringers are not serial numbered. This
beautifully executed piece is a real man stopper in that
its caliber is .510. I obtained this gun from Bernie Braverman
of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania about 1959 at a
Columbus, Ohio gun show.</p>

</div>
<p>#210 This is the second Southern made derringer
that I had in my collection and this is one that I obtained
in Jackson, Mississippi. Notice that it has a bag type
grip and the lock plate is not very deeply curved. Has
standard trigger guard and the nose of the forearm is
fluted. The full octagon barrel is not serial numbered
and has a dove tailed steel base front sight with a German
silver blade. Hammer sets rather high. Through
the trigger guard plate is attached one screw that holds
the barrel in place and then on the forearm forward is
another screw plate holding the screw in position that
attaches the forearm to the barrel in the second position.
Caliber is .510.</p>
<p>The markings on this top flat of the barrel on this
gun are in two lines with letters about the same size as
my other specimens. The markings are as follows:</p>
<p class="center">F. Glassick &amp; Co.

</div>
<p>#211 My first Southern derringer was this Glassick
derringer that I obtained at one of the early Jackson,
Mississippi gun shows about fifteen or sixteen years
ago. My good friend Nathan Swazy brought the gun in
and I traded him two old Civil War swords and a Colt
pistol. You cannot tell it now, but the forearm was
shattered and my good friend Frank Hitchings of Memphis
replaced the forearm in such a manner that the
joint in the new wood cannot be distinguished from the
old. This gun is German silver mounted throughout and
has a fluted forearm nose. There are two screws holding
the barrel in position through the trigger plate and the
nice escutcheon under the forearm. Flat butts are rather
common to many of the Memphis and Nashville guns.
Full octagon barrel with a brass front sight milled into
the steel barrel. Its caliber is a tremendous .510.</p>
<p>The barrel markings on this gun are made in one line,
but contrary to #209 and #214 in which case one stamp
was used, two stamps were used on this one. &ldquo;F. Glassick
&amp; Co.&rdquo; is a different stamp from &ldquo;Memphis, Tenn.&rdquo; The
same stamps were used on #210 as are used on this
one with exception that #210 has the stamps in two
lines and this one is in one line as follows:</p>

<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="530" />
</div>
<p>#274 Little is known about this maker, Suter. No
guns made by Henry Deringer with Suter&rsquo;s name on
the barrel are known.</p>
<p>This particular piece is a small size and has characteristics
of styling that make it desirable. It is German
silver mounted throughout with a pineapple finial on
the trigger plate. There is no screw through the trigger
plate holding the barrel in position. The wedge and the
tang screw are the only attachments to the barrel. No
provision for ramrod. Round barrel has rib at top flat.
The front sight is German silver dovetailed and the rear
of the barrel has two gold bands which enhances its
value. The condition of the gun is extra nice with real
sharp original checkering. The extra thin barrel at the
muzzle is caliber .42.</p>
<p>The barrel is marked on the right hand side below
the top flat &ldquo;steel.&rdquo; The top flat of the barrel is marked
in two lines with two different hand stamps as follows:</p>

<p>#4 This is a photograph of a genuine Wurfflein
Deringer made in Philadelphia. The sideplate of German
silver is absolutely identical to those of most Suter
Deringers. This will leave some room for thought that
Suter Deringers are made by Wurfflein. Notice there
is some similarity in the shape and contour of this Suter
#274 and the illustrated Wurfflein. Both of these guns
are often but not always marked with the word &ldquo;steel&rdquo;
on the right hand barrel flat immediately below the
top flat but always with different size stamps.</p>

<p>#264 I have seen Suter derringers in many sizes
and this is about as large as they come. Although the
barrel is slightly over 4&rdquo;, other derringer makers made
them even longer. The stock is German silver mounted
and has provision for a ramrod. The buttcap is a German
silver rosette held in place by a steel wood screw.
Typical derringer German silver trigger guard with
pineapple finial. Suter was good at copying Henry Deringer&rsquo;s
trigger guard. Two gold bands are at the breech
of the barrel and the front sight is completely made of
German silver that is dovetailed into the flat. Barrel
is round with a rib at the top. Caliber is .410.</p>
<p>All markings of Suter guns that I have seen appear
to be marked with the same two hand stamps with the
name and the town in different stamps. This specimen
is marked in one line with two different stamps as

<h3>HORACE E. DIMICK &amp; CO.</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p15a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="527" />
</div>
<p>#272 H. E. Dimick of course is so well known that
a description of his history of operations is not necessarily
of interest in this little book but we are going to
use it anyway. In the course of several years of collecting,
I have seen no less than 10 or 12 H. E. Dimick derringers,
all with the same type of small markings on the
top barrel flat. Invariably the lock plates are not marked
but do have a floral pattern engraved in place. They
are always long and slender and are not large guns and
are not heavy. This piece is made without ramrod and
with German silver mountings throughout. The trigger
plate finial is in the shape of a pineapple. The barrel
has a brown twist steel imitation finish. The German
silver front sight is milled into the barrel and is not
dovetailed. Caliber is .390.</p>
<p>The barrel is marked on the top flat at a slight angle
showing hand stampings with one die stamp and one
line as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p class="center">H. E. Dimick</p>
<p>This name will be noted in all of the 1859 Saint Louis
City Directories. Dimick was probably the best known
and prolific of all the secondary St. Louis riflemakers
and his guns stood on their own reputation. He came
from Kentucky to establish the St. Louis Gun Shop at
38 North Main Street in 1849. From 1849 through 1864,
the firm was known as H. E. Dimick &amp; Co. From 1865
until Mr. Dimick&rsquo;s death in 1873 the listing was simply
H. E. Dimick. Thus, here is a clue towards dating your
guns with this mark.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of confusion about the
associates in the H. E. Dimick &amp; Co. plant. Henry Folsom
may have been a partner for a few years; he was
at least important enough in the firm to be listed along
with H. E. Dimick in a City Directory.</p>

<h3>F. J. BITTERLICK</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="459" />
</div>
<p>#261 Contrary to most derringers made in the
South, Bitterlick marked his on both the barrel and the
lock. All furniture is of plain, not engraved, German
silver and the escutcheon plate under the forearm embraces
the screw that attaches the forearm to the barrel.
The forearm nose is fluted. The barrel is full octagon,
and its caliber is .400.</p>
<p>The markings are to be found identically on the lock
and the barrel in two lines with one hand stamp marked
as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Fr. J. Bitterlick
<br />Nashville, Tenn.</p>
<p>Franz J. Bitterlick was born July 16, 1829 and died
July 12, 1880 at 51 years and 6 days old. His daughter
Ann Elizabeth married Charles Evers and their descendents
and great grandchildren are living in Nashville
today, 1971.</p>
<p>Joseph Legler was born October 21, 1837 and died
June 15, 1931 at the age of 93 years and 8 months. His
descendents by the name of Legler still live in Nashville
today.</p>
<p>Franz Bitterlick and Joseph Legler were brothers-in-law,
having married sisters Mary and Helen Lochmann
respectively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>There is no record of when Bitterlick first started
operating but if he was born in 1829 and started the
business when he was 25 years old, that would mean
that the Bitterlick Company started about 1854.</p>
<p>The first record of a business using either of these
two names is found in King&rsquo;s City Directory of 1867,
the earliest available, and is listed as Bitterlick &amp; Legler,
Gunsmiths, 22 Deaderich Street. No City Directories
are available before 1867 so it is entirely possible
that the combination of the two names originated before
that date.</p>
<p>Considering that in 1867, Legler was 30 years old and
considering the point that he could have been a partner
of Bitterlick as early as 25 years of age means that the
Bitterlick &amp; Legler Company could have started around
1862.</p>
<p>In an interview in 1970 with Mr. Bernard Evers, Sr.,
the grandson of Bitterlick, he stated he believed the
gunsmith business started in 1854, give or take a year,
and that Bitterlick made himself scarce during the War
Between the States by taking a four year &ldquo;Round the
World&rdquo; trip.</p>
<p>All in all it would average up that the company of
Bitterlick operated from perhaps 1854 to 1862 or 1865.</p>
<p>Bitterlick and Legler without a doubt operated from
1862-65 til the last listing of the combination company
in the King&rsquo;s City Directory of 1879.</p>
<p>In 1880 Joseph Legler is listed as a gunsmith and
Frank Bitterlick as a grocer at two different addresses.</p>
<p>Thus from these dates that we have accumulated here
you can tell approximately when your gun was made
according to the name on the barrel, and that no derringers
were produced after 1879 because none are
known marked &ldquo;Legler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to a news clipping dated March 1, 1963 of
the Nashville Tennessean newspaper, the J. Legler, Gunsmith
business was sold on that date and it is noted that
the operation was started 95 years ago on Deaderich
Street which would make the business starting in 1868.
To me this does not quite add up since the City Directories
state that they were operating in 1867. I would
say that the business started sometime between 1854
and 1867.</p>
<p>Joseph Legler is buried in the Mt. Olive Cemetery
near Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the Legler descendents
with the same name operated this business as a gunsmith
at 321 Deaderich Street until December 31, 1962
when the business was closed out. The building was
sold to a real estate agent on March 1, 1963.</p>
<p>All their pistols were high quality. In addition to
derringer type pieces it is known that Bitterlick produced
and manufactured shotguns and a few target rifles
marked &ldquo;FR. J. Bitterlick &amp; Co., Nashville, Tenn.&rdquo;.
Early double breechloading shotguns with outside hammers
are known that are marked &ldquo;J. Leghler, Nashville,
Tenn.&rdquo; and will you please note the new spelling of Legler
in this later breechloading period.</p>

</div>
<p>#285 This is a small sized derringer by any standards
and is made by Bitterlick. I have never seen a
Bitterlick smaller than this one. This gun also has the
escutcheon screw plate underneath the forearm attaching
that part to the full octagon barrel. The forearm
nose is fluted as is common to many of these Nashville
and Memphis guns. All furniture is of German silver
and is plain, not engraved.</p>
<p>The barrel markings are slightly different from #261
in that the expression &ldquo;&amp; Co.&rdquo; has been added as follows:</p>

<h3>{FOOT-POWERED LATHE}</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="531" />
</div>
<p>#285A This is a real old foot powered metal turning
lathe that is in our collection here at Dixie Gun Works.
It was obtained from the current Snodgrass Gun Shop
in Nashville and Mr. Snodgrass states that many, many
years ago he got it from the old Legler Gun Shop. There
is an awfully good chance that parts such as screws for
the Bitterlick or Bitterlick &amp; Legler Derringers were
made on this same lathe. Incidentally, Hal Swann of
Nashville has a large quantity of Bitterlick or Bitterlick
&amp; Legler tools such as files, bullet mould cherries, screwdrivers
and even a die stamp reading &ldquo;Bitterlick &amp; Co.&rdquo;
This die stamp is not the same one that is used on the
derringers though. This die stamp has never been seen
on a gun.</p>

<h3>LULLMAN &amp; VIENNA</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p18a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="506" />
</div>
<p>#266 Lullman and Vienna apparently was a retail
store dealing in guns, watches, and jewelry. I have never
seen a Lullman and Vienna marked gun except for those
that are genuine Henry Deringer guns. Or, in other
words, they did not make their own guns.</p>
<p>This specimen is German silver mounted throughout,
without ramrod and with a tear drop buttcap. Typical
round Henry Deringer barrel with a flat rib on top. Full
dovetailed German silver front sight. The breech of the
barrel has two silver bands which enhances its value.</p>
<p>All guns by this maker were invariably marked with
the same die stamp and two lines with one stamp manufactured
as one unit. The stampings reads as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Lullman &amp; Vienna,
<br />Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h3>LULLMAN &amp; VIENNA</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="532" />
</div>
<p>#258 A very desirable sized derringer with a short
barrel and many people call this the Abe Lincoln model
which is true except for the marking on the barrel. This
gun is German silver mounted throughout, and made
without ramrod. Solid German silver front sight is dovetailed
into position. The rear of the barrel has two silver
bands. Has typical Henry Deringer markings on the lock
and on the breechplug. The caliber is .410.</p>
<p>The barrel markings are typically as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Lullman &amp; Vienna,

<p>#254 An even smaller sized Lullman and Vienna
derringer is this genuine Henry Deringer gun that is
marked with this agent&rsquo;s name on the barrel. German
silver throughout and you will notice that this gun
does not have a ramrod like all the others by this same
maker in my collection. I wonder if all were sold to Lullman
and Vienna without ramrods? Solid German silver
front sight dovetailed in place along with two silver
barrel bands at the breech. Its caliber is .380.</p>
<p>The barrel markings are typically as follows:</p>

<h3>BITTERLICK &amp; LEGLER</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="531" />
</div>
<p>#262 This Bitterlick specimen is typical of his
earlier guns except for the later markings on the barrel.
The full octagon barrel is held in place by two screws
through the forearm and through the trigger plate directly
into the barrel. The escutcheons and furniture
are all of plain German silver with no engraving whatsoever.
Has German silver pin type front sight with gold
band at the breech. The breech is marked with the
number &ldquo;I.&rdquo; All metal parts show old milling marks and
file marks because of its excellent condition. Caliber is
.470.</p>
<p>The identical markings are to be found on both the
barrel and the lock and two different hand stamps are
used as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Fr. J. Bitterlick &amp; Legler
<br />Nashville, Tenn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h3>STEPHEN O&rsquo;DELL</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p20a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="529" />
</div>
<p>#222 O&rsquo;Dell guns are often times easily recognized
by their characteristic European influence. The grips
are a little different in this shape gun in that they are
the flat bag type instead of a rounded bag type which
is more of an English style than American. The round
faced hammer does not follow the characteristics of
Southern derringers. All furniture is of German silver
and of the highest quality casting and are fully engraved
with English line scroll engraving. The trigger plate
has a pineapple finial and through the trigger plate is
the typical Southern style screw that attaches the forearm
to the barrel along with the barrel being held in
place by a wedge.</p>
<p>I need to mention that there are several known Henry
Deringer made guns that are marked in one line on the
barrel and with a hand stamp &ldquo;S. O&rsquo;Dell.&rdquo; In this specimen
that we present here that is marked on the lock
plate, the name is hand engraved in and is not stamped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>This ornate specimen has five gold and silver bands
at the breech. The barrel is rounded with a rib flat on
top. The silver front sight is machined into place. The
lockplate is filed down to fit the wood with more of a
cross curve than Henry Deringer guns show. The caliber
is unusually small, it being only .330.</p>
<p>This gun is marked on the lock only as follows:</p>
<p class="center">S. O&rsquo;Dell</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Dell came from New York State probably in the
late 1830&rsquo;s or early 1840&rsquo;s and according to newspaper
accounts of that period was murdered in the early 1860&rsquo;s
at Natchez. Although his derringers had bag shaped
grips and not bird head grips, I am classifying them as
a derringer rather than a pocket pistol. Halfstock rifles
with his name are known.</p>

<h3>SCHNEIDER &amp; GLASSICK</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig36">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="464" />
</div>
<p>#215 Schneider and Glassick derringers have characteristics
of both of these earlier companies that merged
to form this one. All furniture is very plain German
silver without even the least line engraving. There is
a screw through the trigger plate holding the barrel into
position along with the typical wedge. The full octagon
barrel is rather plain with no embellishments at
the breech. The caliber is .450.</p>
<p>The markings are in one line with one stamp on the
top flat of the barrel as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Schneider &amp; Glassick, Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p>Schneider &amp; Glassick, gunsmiths, formed about 1859
by William S. Schneider and Frederick G. Glassick, both
of whom had previously operated independently. They
early secured a Confederate contract to manufacture revolvers,
this being in addition to the repairing of other
types of firearms. They advertised in March, 1862, advising
persons who had left &ldquo;guns or pistols longer than
three months&rdquo; to call, as they intended delivering all
such arms to the Confederate government as of March
15th.</p>
<p>Shortly after this advertising date of March 7, 1862,
Memphis was evacuated by all Confederate Ordnance
activities, and the firm was not heard from again.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="526" />
</div>
<p>#6 Although in deplorable condition, this Schneider
and Glassick can be restored and I am going to spend
upwards of $200 to have the trigger guard and the
hammer made new. Notice the extra long length of the
grip and of the bird head shape. The barrel is held in
place both by a trigger plate screw and a wedge. The
front sight is a brass blade milled into the steel barrel
with no engraving or ornamentation at the breech. Notice
the heavy downward curve of the lock. Caliber is
.500.</p>
<p>The barrel markings are done with the same stamp
as used on gun #215 which is a one piece stamp in one
line as follows:</p>

</div>
<p>#225 W. H. Calhoun was a fancy goods merchant in
Nashville, Tennessee during and well before the Civil
War. Fancy goods merchants sold jewelry, watches,
and guns which sort of fitted together in those days
and times. Calhoun never made guns himself as far as
I know and was not a gunsmith. This is a genuine Henry
Deringer gun surcharged or marked with the agent&rsquo;s
name on the barrel. This gun has typical Henry Deringer
characteristics such as German silver furniture and
a pineapple finial on the trigger plate. The stock is made
without ramrod. The caliber is .370.</p>
<p>The barrel markings are in four lines on the top flat
and appear to be marked each line individually as
follows:</p>
<p class="center">Man<sup>d</sup> for
<br />W. H. Calhoun
<br />Agent,

<h3>DANIEL L. SWETT &amp; CO.</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="536" />
</div>
<p>#282 L. Swett was a dealer of guns and general
merchandise in Vicksburg, Mississippi and as far as I
know never made guns himself. The guns that I have
seen by this maker were all Henry Deringer agent marked
guns. This speciment is very typical of a genuine
Henry Deringer such as with ramrod, German silver
furniture, and pineapple finial on the trigger plate.</p>
<p>The barrel markings are in three lines and it appears
to be one stamp because each line is so perfect when
compared with the other. The markings are as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Made for
<br />L. Swett &amp; Co.
<br />Vicksburg, Miss.</p>
<p>This name represents an agent primarily since no
guns not of Henry Deringer manufacture are known.
Newspaper advertisements of that period show he
operated in the late 1850&rsquo;s. It is interesting to notice
that Mrs. Jefferson Davis carried a Swett derringer in
her purse. The gun is now on display in the old capitol
museum in Jackson, Mississippi.</p>

<h3 id="c3">J. A. SCHAFER</h3>
<p>J. A. Schafer. Vicksburg, Mississippi, is one gun that
I do not have and I would like to obtain. I have heard of
three of these guns and they are always Henry Deringer
guns surcharged with this agent&rsquo;s name and without a
doubt all will be typical of Henry Deringer manufactury.</p>

<h3>L. F. TRUMPLER</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig40">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="527" />
</div>
<p>#204 Trumpler of Little Rock does not make a gun
that looks like a Henry Deringer or a Southern Derringer.
His guns are entirely different. Notice the funny
nosecap, the tall hammer, and the extra narrow trigger
guard and trigger plate. Although the trigger plate ends
in a finial of a pineapple, it is not a Henry Deringer type
of pineapple. This derringer has a silver band at the
breech with a small amount of engraving. The barrel is
round with a rib on top. Its caliber is .430.</p>
<p>The only markings are on the barrel as follows in one
line:</p>

<p>#278 J. B. Gilmore, Shreveport, Louisiana, produced
guns by his own hand and he also used Henry Deringer
guns that were surcharged with his own name. This
particular gun is rather slender and it has a nice appealing
style, it being manufactured by Gilmore himself.
Notice the turned down forearm nose. The gun is mounted
with German silver furniture lightly engraved. The
barrel is round with a flat rib on top. Its caliber is .380.</p>
<p>The only markings are on the top of the barrel flat
as follows:</p>
<p class="center">J. B. GILMORE</p>
<p>Jerome Bonaparte Gilmore was born in Jefferson
County, Kentucky, in 1827, and came to Shreveport, La.
in 1849. There is a strong possibility that he was the
son of J. Gilmore, of the firm J. Gilmore and Moses
Dickson, Gunmakers, of Louisville (1848-1860), as,
according to the census of 1840, J. Gilmore, Sr. had a
son of about this age. J. B. Gilmore worked for David
Pobst, gunmaker, until about 1853 when young Gilmore
went into the gun business for himself. The 1850 census
lists both Pobst and Gilmore in the same recorders
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
visit which usually means that they were members of
the same household, possibly roommates. Advertisements
for both Pobst and Gilmore appear in the Caddo Gazette
in 1853, and seem to indicate that they are competitors.
An ad in the Caddo Gazette, 3 Feb., 1855 is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

which time I have visited the best Gun Manufacturers
of the West and South, that I might
make myself acquainted with the more recent
and valuable improvements in gunnery. And
can now assure my customers that any work
entrusted to me will be finished in the best style,
with such valuable improvements as have been
made in the work. I will keep constantly on hand

</blockquote>
<p>As Gilmore&rsquo;s shop was located on the trail to Texas
(highway 80 today), it is likely that he furnished many
settlers and frontiersmen with guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>In 1860, Caddo Parish had 1153 registered voters. In
1860 Caddo Parish sent 1500 men to war. On the 17th
day of May 1861, J. B. Gilmore entered the military
service of the Confederate States of America as Captain
of &ldquo;F&rdquo; Company, Shreveport Rangers, 3rd Regiment,
Louisiana Infantry. His regiment was transported by
the steamer &ldquo;Grand Duke&rdquo; to New Orleans and then
proceeded to Fort Smith, Ark., reporting to General Ben
McCulloch, commanding the Army of the West. He
served with his command in all the skermishes and fights
including the battles of Oak Hills and Elk Horn in Ark.
and Mo. On the 1st of May 1862, his regiment arrived
at Corinth, Miss., where it was reorganized on the 8th
of May. As a result of this reorganization, Gilmore was
elected Lt. Colonel. Lt. Colonel Gilmore participated in
the skermishes at Farmington and other points near
Corinth. Col. F. C. Armstrong was appointed a Brigadier
General, and on 6 July took leave of the regiment.
Soon after Gilmore was appointed to full Colonel by
President Davis and assumed command of the regiment.
At the battle of Iuka, Miss., on 19 Sept., 1862, Col. Gilmore
was severely wounded and, not being able to withdraw
with his regiment, was captured. He was paroled
on the 23rd of Sept., and rejoined his regiment at Snyder&rsquo;s
Bluff. He was with the regiment during their investment
at Vicksburg, Miss., but being very weak did
not assume command. He resigned his command on 7
July, 1863 and was paroled with his regiment but never
exchanged.</p>
<p>Upon his return from the war he joined a cotton firm
as a buyer. It is probable that his wound prevented him
from carrying on his gun business. In 1860 he had purchased
three lots from Leroy M. Nutt for $2300, and in
1872 built a substantial residence on this site. The first
City Directory (1878) lists him as residing at 506 Cotton
St.</p>
<p>Gilmore&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s name was Emma and he had a son,
Edwin Vincent. During the carpetbagger era he was
Mayor of Shreveport, and was known as a man of fine
character. He was a member of the &ldquo;General LeRoy
Stafford Camp No. 3, United Confederate Veterans&rdquo;
and it was men from this camp that served as pall bearers
at his funeral in 1900. Jerome Bonaparte Gilmore&rsquo;s
tombstone lies in lot 22, section 33 of the Greenwood
Cemetery, Shreveport, La., just 20 steps from the
graves of his Confederate comrades in arms.</p>

<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="528" />
</div>
<p>#258 This is a Gilmore gun that is manufactured
by Henry Deringer. It has typical derringer markings
on the lock plate and the breechplug. It is mounted in
German silver in a typical fashion. The only difference
in this and most Henry Deringers is that the trigger
plate finial is not a pineapple. Made with ramrod. Its
caliber is .440.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/p25a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="535" />
</div>
<p>#205 Linde is a lesser known gunmaker of Memphis
and he is authenticated through newspaper advertisements
of those days. Little is known of his history. This
particular gun has a different shape stock and notice
the turned down forearm nose that is fluted. The furniture
is not engraved. Notice the different shaped hammer.
The barrel is round with a top barrel flat. The
front sight is German silver dovetailed into place.</p>
<p>The only markings are on both the barrel and the
lock as follows:</p>
<p class="center">A. Linde</p>

<h3>HENRY FOLSOM</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="460" />
</div>
<p>#220 Folsom was a well known manufacturer and
dealer of New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. This
particular handsome little gun with its 1&#8542;&rdquo; barrel was
manufactured by him and is not a Henry Deringer product
although it has characteristics exactly like old
Henry of Philadelphia. All furniture is of German silver.
This is the size of derringer that I would call a gambler&rsquo;s
vest pocket special. Its caliber is .390.</p>
<p>The only mark is on the lock itself as follows:</p>
<p class="center">H. Folsom</p>
<p>He was a gunsmith and military outfitter who in the
late 1850&rsquo;s was located in St. Louis, Missouri, and who
for a time was there connected with H. E. Dimick, a
gunsmith and dealer in imitation Colt Navy Revolvers.</p>
<p>Folsom was entirely Southern in feeling and about
1859 left St. Louis for New Orleans, Louisiana. There
he opened up a shop at 55 Chartres Street. Imported
revolvers are occasionally found bearing his name.</p>
<p>Also to be found with his name and the St. Louis address
are various types of swords.</p>
<p>Some rifles are known that are marked &ldquo;H. Folsom
&amp; Co., St. Louis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is first listed in 1866 in the St. Louis City Directory
and again in 1870 as a dealer and gunsmith.</p>
<p>It is known that Folsom worked in Memphis at some
time and it is possible and reasonable that he made deringers
there and in St. Louis but with a different marking,
leaving off the St. Louis in the case of the Memphis
guns.</p>

<h3>A. WEISGERBER</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig45">

</div>
<p>#256 Weisgerber was an authenticated maker according
to newspapers of those days of derringers, shotguns,
and rifles. To date, I know of one rifle and two
derringer pistols, one of which is in my collection. Notice
the heavy bag grip and the unusual shaped hammer.
The forearm nose is fluted. All parts are German silver,
not engraved, and the inlays are held in place with wood
screws which is contrary to the vast majority of the
others in my collection. Its caliber is .440.</p>
<p>The only markings are on the top barrel flat as follows
in two lines:</p>

<p>#219 Again we have a Memphis maker, whose name
was Merriman, that little is known of but he is authenticated
as a derringer maker by newspaper accounts. This
gun has a rounded face European style hammer that
appears to be original with the gun and all furniture is
German silver. There is some engraving on the inlays.
There is no provision for a ramrod. Its caliber is .410.</p>

<h3 id="c4">LOUIS HOFFMAN</h3>
<p>As far as I know Hoffman was a derringer maker
himself and did not use any Henry Deringer guns that
were surcharged. I only know of two of these guns and
I am sorry that I am not able to obtain them for photographing.
I can tell you that they are highly ornate
similar to the O&rsquo;Dell manufactured guns. Hoffman was
located in Vicksburg.</p>
<p>Louis Ferdinand Alexander Hoffmann was born in
Berlin, Prussia in 1823. His father was an officer in the
Prussian army but died when Louis was 9. His mother
died when he was 11, leaving five orphan children. Louis
came to America in 1852 settling for a short time in
Patterson, New Jersey, then moving to St. Louis, Missouri
and on to Vicksburg in 1854.</p>
<p>During his early years in Europe he was brought up
in the machine shop of Borsig of Berlin, then the largest
of its kind in Europe. This fact later may explain the
heavy European influence on Mr. Hoffmann&rsquo;s guns.</p>
<p>From 1854 til 1857 he worked in Vicksburg at the
Zimmerman and Reading Foundry, learning the art of
metal craft. In 1857 at the age of 34 he had saved enough
money to start his own business.</p>
<p>His first ad in the Vicksburg Daily Whig dated October,
1857 states: &ldquo;New gun shop&mdash;Louis Hoffmann
takes pleasure in informing his community and the
public generally that he will carry on the gunsmith business
and all its branches. It will make rifles to order,
stock guns and pistols, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 1860 Vicksburg City Directory list six gunsmiths
working for him, One of these was Adam Schafer who
later went into the retail business himself and Philadelphia
Henry Deringers are known to be marked with his
agency&rsquo;s name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Hoffmann&rsquo;s earliest known address was listed in 1857
as China Street and later on Washington Street. The
Washington Street store burned in 1879 and new buildings
were erected on Clay Street. This became known
as the famous &ldquo;Hoffmann Block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1886 the former Louis Hoffmann or Hoffmann
Hardware Company was incorporated and the name
changed to Louis Hoffmann Hardware Company, Inc.,
Hoffmann Block, Vicksburg, Mississippi.</p>
<p>Depending of these mentioned names and addresses,
you can date your guns roughly.</p>
<p>The successors of the Hoffmann Hardware &amp; Gun
Company is in business today under the name of O&rsquo;Neill
McNamarra Hardware Company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h3>JAMES CONNING</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="462" />
</div>
<p>#241 Generally this Conning derringer follows the
description of a genuine Henry Deringer gun in both
style and makeup but is not a Henry Deringer. The trigger
guard and other furniture is of German silver and
there is no provision for a ramrod. Notice the turned
down lip at the forearm nose. The round barrel is made
with a barrel rib at the top. The only barrel markings
underneath the barrel are a cryptic assembly number
cut in Roman numerals so this gun is apparently American
made because there are no proof marks. I have never
heard of another such gun. Its caliber is .410.</p>
<p>The only markings are on the barrel in two lines in
script and engraved as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Made for
<br />J. Conning, Mobile</p>
<p>This maker advertised that his shop was open for
business at Dauphin and Water Streets in Mobile, Alabama.
This will leave the impression that he operated
a retail store but so far no actual proof of this has been
noted except that on October 21, 1862 he advertised
&ldquo;military buttons just received a few gross of very
fine military gold staff buttons, sold by the gross or
the set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had some facilities for manufacturing and is well
known for his Confederate swords. There is a record
of an important contract with the state of Alabama for
sabres.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h3>A. R. MENDENHALL</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="487" />
</div>
<p>#259 Mendenhall of the little town of DesArc, Arkansas
produced derringers that had no characteristics
of either the Mississippi derringer makers, those of
Nashville or of Memphis. His were entirely different.
Notice the heavy walnut stock, the long slender hammer,
and the pewter nosecap. Has provision for the
ramrod in the nosecap. The trigger guard is of steel and
all other furniture is of German silver held in place with
pins. There is a screw through the trigger guard that
attaches to the barrel along with a wedge to hold the
barrel in place. The barrel has two bands of gold and
silver at the breech and the front sight is dovetailed
German silver. The lockplate is plain with no engraving
whatsoever as is the hammer. The grips are checkered
with a bird head style. The caliber is .500.</p>
<p>The only markings are on the barrel with a one piece
machine made hand stamp in two lines as follows:</p>
<p class="center">A. R. Mendenhall
<br />DesArc, Ark.</p>
<p>From Charles Elias, North Little Rock, Arkansas
comes certain information on this deringer maker that
he has dug out of the U.S. Census files of Arkansas
taken every decade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>In 1836, the year Arkansas became a state in the Union,
the present location of the town of DesArc was
known as McNulty&rsquo;s Bluff and was nothing more than
a ferry crossing the White River at this point&mdash;the most
eastern edge of what was then Pulaski County. It wasn&rsquo;t
until the early 1840&rsquo;s that the townsite was laid out and
became known as DesArc. Today the population is
about 500.</p>
<p>A R. Mendenhall was born in 1836. It is realistic to
assume that at the age of 25, in 1860, this young man
could have had the capabilities of fashioning this type
of weapon.</p>
<p>In the year 1860, this man, along with a wagonmaker
named John Langford, resided with the family of William
H. Harvey whose occupation was listed in the U.S.
Census of that year as a &ldquo;grocery keeper.&rdquo; Mendenhall
was 24 years old and single. His native state was Michigan;
his occupation, gunsmith. He owned no real property,
but assessed $200.00 in personal property.</p>
<p>Mendenhall&rsquo;s name appears again in the U.S. Census
of 1870. By this time, he had married a young Tennessee
woman and gave his native state as Ohio. In both real
and personal property, he listed his net worth as a little
less than $1,000.00. Residing with him was another man
whose occupation was listed as &ldquo;grocery keeper.&rdquo; William
H. Harvey had disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Other sources state that a Mendenhall worked in the
&ldquo;Confederate States Ordnance Works&rdquo; at Tyler, Texas
which operated from 1862 to 1865. According to this
book in my library, Mendenhall was the best workman
in the armoury and was engaged in some capacity with
pistol making. Could this be the same man?</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that any Mendenhall Derringer
was produced in 1860 or later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h3>J. HAUSMANN</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig49">
<img src="images/p30.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="487" />
</div>
<p>#242 J. Hausmann was an arms dealer before the
Civil War in New Orleans. Little is known about him.
Notice that this gun has definite Southern characteristics
of some of the Memphis and Nashville guns in the
screw plate under the forearm that holds the barrel to
the forearm, the fluted nose of the forearm, and the full
octagon barrel. All furniture is likewise plain as is characteristic
of many of these guns. The grips are bird head
shaped and are protected at the butt with a tear drop
inlay. There is a screw through the trigger plate holding
to the barrel. The caliber is .410.</p>
<p>A friend in Memphis has in his collection an identical
gun marked #1 on the tang. Mine is marked #2. I got
my gun from Bob Elz of California and the #1 was
found in Ohio. Neither of us will sell his gun and we are
at a standstill about getting these two identical guns
into one collection. No other derringers by this maker
are known.</p>
<p>The only markings are on the lock plate itself, hand
engraved, as follows:</p>
<p class="center">J. Hausmann</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h3 id="c5">A. J. MILLSPAUGH</h3>
<p>A. J. Millspaugh operated in Shreveport, Louisiana.
I have never seen one of his guns nor heard of anyone
that had one except in one book a mention is made that
Philadelphia derringers are known with his name. I do
not personally believe he would be any more scarce than
a Linde or a Weisgerber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h3 id="c6">HOLYOAKE-LOWNES</h3>
<p>Holyoake-Lownes of Memphis, Tennessee was an importer
of English made derringer type guns with his
name surcharged on the barrel. I have heard of one gun
only with this marking and it of course has English
proof marks but has positive features of a genuine
Henry Deringer gun.</p>
<p>A description of the only known gun is as follows:
The round barrel with the rib on top is rifled and is caliber
.490. Barrel length is 3&#8541;&rdquo; and the overall length is
7&frac34;&rdquo;. Two silver bands at breech. Oval silver wedge
escutcheons. Monogram plate in the shape of a rectangle
with clipped corners. German silver fore end cap is made
for loading rod. Eight cornered daisy design German
silver butt cap.</p>
<p>This company advertised guns for sale in the &ldquo;Memphis
Daily Appeal&rdquo; of Wednesday, May 4, 1853.</p>
<p>The top flat of the barrel is marked in one line with
one die stamp &ldquo;Holyoake-Lownes &amp; Co. Memphis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h3>F. SCHUMANN</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/p31.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="534" />
</div>
<p>#201 F. Schumann is identified as a maker of derringers
by old newspaper accounts. None of my collector
friends or dealer friends have ever heard of or seen a
genuine Schumann derringer and I am indeed fortunate
in obtaining this specimen of a barrel whose caliber is
.410 and is full octagon. This barrel turned up in Memphis
about twenty-five or thirty years ago in an old
gun shop where it was obtained and kept in a collection
thereafter. It has never been on a gun and still shows
the old original file marks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h3>E. R. SIEBER</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/p32.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="463" />
</div>
<p>#286 Sieber of Nashville, Tennessee is virtually unknown
among my gun collector friends and dealers until
this gun turned up in Norman Flayderman&rsquo;s catalog in
1970. It is definitely Nashville made with the characteristics
of those guns in the full octagon barrel, the escutcheon
plate under the forearm holding the screw to
attach the barrel, and the lack of engraving. The buttcap,
sideplate, nameplate on the wrist, and escutcheons
are of German silver. The trigger guard, believe it or
not, is of brass and appears to be original. The barrel
is a little different in that the bottom half is rounded
with the top half octagon. To say this another way,
there are three octagon flats at the top of the barrel
with the other part underneath rounded. There is a gold
blow-out plug on the breechplug. Two bands at the
breech are of gold and silver and one silver band at the
muzzle. It is a shame, but someone in the past has sand-papered
the barrel which is in extra fine condition. They
saw the old brown color and thought they were removing
rust when actually the gun had original browning on
the barrel and some smart fellow removed all of it. I
would call this a high quality but plain derringer. Its
caliber is .440.</p>
<p>The only markings are on the top barrel flat as follows:</p>
<p class="center">E. R. Sieber,

<h3 id="c7">H. G. NEWCOMB</h3>
<p>H. G. Newcomb is a little known maker of Vicksburg,
Mississippi who made his own derringers. I have only
heard of two guns by this maker and they are in a collection
in Mississippi and maybe sometime we can obtain
this specimen for photographing and describing.</p>
<p>Apparently Newcomb was active about the same time
as O&rsquo;Dell but he lived into the early 1870&rsquo;s. Two of his
derringers are known and one is even more ornate than
O&rsquo;Dell produced guns while the other is very plain. It
is rumored that some genuine Henry Deringers were
agent marked with Newcomb&rsquo;s name but I have never
personally seen one of these guns.</p>

<p>#221 Here is an unmarked derringer that could
have been made either in Nashville or in Memphis according
to the sheath trigger and the flat butt. Bitterlick
produced guns of this style and marked them but
I do not have one for my collection. Notice that this
is made of curly maple rather than like all the rest of
walnut. The full octagon barrel has one silver band at
the breech. The tang is marked with &ldquo;#1&rdquo;. There is no
way to determine whether this gun was made in Nashville
or Memphis. Its caliber is .480.</p>

</div>
<p>#212 Having no characteristics whatsoever of any
other known Southern derringer maker is this specimen
from my collection that I have had for ten or twelve
years. The tear drop buttcap, the wedge plate escutcheons,
the silver inlay under the barrel and the left hand
sideplate and name plate over the wrist are all plain
with no engraving which is typical of Southern guns.
There is no provision for ramrod. Notice the forearm
nose is fluted and that it is turned downward somewhat.
The trigger guard is steel and does have the Southern
type of screw through the trigger plate attaching to
the barrel. The lock plate has a very high radius curve
to make it fit the curve of the wrist. The round barrel
is flat on top. The dovetailed steel base front sight has
a German silver blade. Notice that the hammer is not
derringer style in that it has a slightly rounded face.
No proof marks under barrel. This gun is in exceedingly
fine condition, and I would say almost like new. Its caliber
is .450.</p>

<p>#206 Here is an unidentifiable hand made Southern
type derringer with markings on the barrel that are
hand cut and very crude as follows: &ldquo;J. E. B.&rdquo; The
wood is curly maple and the trigger guard and trigger
plate are steel with no butt cap on the flat butt. There
is a screw through the trigger plate attaching the forearm
to the barrel. This can be seen in the photograph.
The rifled bore is caliber .500.</p>

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
